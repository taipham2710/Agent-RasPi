```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Backend not accessible**
   ```bash
   # Check if backend is running
   curl http://localhost:8000/health
   
   # Restart backend
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

2. **Agents not starting**
   ```bash
   # Check Docker status
   docker ps
   
   # Restart agents
   ./scripts/demo_manager.sh restart
   ```

3. **Slack notifications not working**
   ```bash
   # Check environment variable
   echo $SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL
   
   # Test webhook
   curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' \
     --data '{"text":"Test message"}' \
     $SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL
   ```

### Performance Tips
- Use `./scripts/demo_manager.sh scale 10` for lighter demos
- Monitor system resources with `./scripts/demo_manager.sh status`
- Clean up after demo with `./scripts/demo_manager.sh clean`
